            <p>These terms and conditions applies to the WeatherMaster app (hereby referred to as "Application") for
                mobile devices that was created by Pranshul (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open
                Source service.</p><br>
            <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms.
                It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the
                Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or
                our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application,
                translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All
                trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the
                Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p><br>
            <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as
                possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at
                any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application
                or its services will be clearly communicated to you.</p><br>
            <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in
                order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and
                access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your
                phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
                operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious
                programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not
                functioning correctly or at all.</p><!----><br>
            <p>Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some
                functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided
                by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application
                does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data
                allowance.</p><br>
            <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network
                provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile
                provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By
                using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                charges if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without
                disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the
                application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.</p><br>
            <p>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the
                application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If
                your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider
                cannot be held responsible.</p><br>
            <p>In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to
                note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on
                third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service
                Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of
                relying entirely on this functionality of the application.</p><br>
            <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently
                available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they
                decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download
                the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee
                that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
                particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept
                updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease
                providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice
                to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
                to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete
                it from your device.</p><br><strong>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</strong>
            <p>The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised
                to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes
                by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p><br>
            <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2024-06-16</p><br><strong>Contact Us</strong>
            <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about the Terms and Conditions, please do not hesitate to
                contact the Service Provider at</p>
