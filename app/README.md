# The code is a little messy

### Why is the package `com.example.weathermaster`?

- Well, when I made this, I didn’t know a whole lot about Android development, and I didn’t realize you had to change the package name. So I made it with com.example, and now I can’t really change it because that would make it a whole new app. People who installed it from F-Droid may not get updates, so it's a bit of a messy situation. I might change the package name if I publish the app on the Google Play Store.
